# User1st Hackathon (5/25/21)

## Challenge
Automate the identification of date picker trigger elements & container elements

## Solution
Pre-train a BERT model network with HTML represented in Emmet syntax, and leverage the resultant network to fine tune a model to identify HTML as a datepicker trigger or container element as a binary classification task.
